[–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—è](README.ru.md)

A powerful and flexible Python game development library built on top of Pygame, created by neoxider.

## Overview

spritePro is a comprehensive 2D game development framework that extends Pygame with advanced sprite management, physics simulation, UI components, and utility functions. It's designed to accelerate game development while maintaining flexibility and ease of use.

## Key Features

- **üéÆ Advanced Sprite System** - Movement, animations, visual effects, and state management
- **‚ö° Physics Engine** - Realistic physics with gravity, forces, and collision detection  
- **üñ±Ô∏è Interactive UI** - Buttons, text rendering, and mouse interaction handling
- **‚è±Ô∏è Timing System** - Precise timers, scheduling, and smooth animations
- **üíö Health Management** - Damage, healing, regeneration, and death handling
- **üé® Visual Effects** - Rounded corners, masking, scaling, and color effects

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NeoXider/SpritePro.git

# Add to your project
# Place the spritePro folder in your project directory
```

## Quick Start

```python
import spritePro as s

# Initialize and create window
s.init()
s.get_screen((800, 600), "My Game")

# Create a player sprite
player = s.Sprite("player.png", pos=(400, 300), speed=5)

# Game loop
while True:
    s.update(fill_color=(50, 50, 100))
    player.update()
```

## Use Cases

- **2D Platformers** - Physics sprites with gravity and collision
- **RPG Games** - Health systems, inventory UI, and character management  
- **Puzzle Games** - Interactive buttons and smooth animations
- **Arcade Games** - Fast sprite movement and visual effects
- **Educational Games** - Simple UI and text rendering
